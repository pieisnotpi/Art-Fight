# Art-Fight
Art fight is a very small Java program for generating quick drawing prompts.
It features fully customizable lists for nouns, adjectives, and prompt templates for endless customization.

Examples of generated prompts:
* The kind've thing only a flabbergasted dolphin would invent
* A drunk horse fighting a stoned piece of toast
* A frankly far too ecstatic child
* If all children were replaced by sharks
* A pirate ship made solely out of lawn chairs and couches

And many, many more (25,950 more, to be exact)
